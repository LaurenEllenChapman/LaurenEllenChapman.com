    <p>Byron Ernest, head of schools for Hoosier Academies, was appointed to the State Board of Education in May 2015 by Indiana House Speaker Brian Bosma for a four-year term. The Indiana State Teachers Association and others have questioned whether the board has been slow to sanction Hoosier Virtual Academy because of his membership. Ernest has recused himself from all discussions about Hoosier Virtual. (Eric Weddle/WFYI News)</p>
