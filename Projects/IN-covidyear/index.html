		<h1>One year of COVID-19 in Indiana</h1>
		<h3>It's been nearly a year since Indiana reported its first case and first death from COVID-19, and we&rsquo;re still in the middle of our "new normal." Indiana Public Broadcasting and Side Effects Public Media want to hear your stories about what&rsquo;s changed for you in the last year. We're gathering stories of the people we've lost, the triumphs, the recoveries, and the changes Hoosiers have experienced in the last year.</h3>
