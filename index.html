					<p>I got into journalism because my high school counselor wouldn't let me take the class I wanted to. She told me to take the newspaper class. I told her I thought journalism was stupid and fluffy.</p>
					<p>Fast forward seven years and I'm now the digital producer for IPB News, a statewide reporting team for the NPR and PBS affiliates in Indiana.</p>
					<p>I have the best job in the whole wide world. In addition to the nebulous job title of digital producer, I'm a radio and television reporter for the network, stepping in to assist when resources are limited.</p>

					<p>And in September 2016, I become one of the first people to implement the Public Media Platform as a content sharing and aggregation tool on all of the websites in Indiana. I've worked with the project managers at NPR for Core Publisher and PMP to make this happen and help work out some of the quirks of that roll-out.</p>

						<p>Thankfully, the energy and environment reporter I work with is pretty much game for what ever weird web thing I want to do. This is a result of that.</p>

						<h2>Outstanding Senior Award controversy ignites desire for conversation on racial sensitivity at Ball State</h2>
						<p><em>I got to write this story because of the relationships I established with social rights groups on Ball State's campus. Covering campus protests became my unofficial beat. I received a tip that the people involved in this story would be willing to talk to me. There aren't any photos with the story because the images we could have used would only have promoted one side of the story or the other. I got to approach a very sensitive story with maturity I wouldn't have had a few years ago.</em></p>
							<p>At 10:55 a.m. March 16, students received an email from the university announcing senior journalism and telecommunications major Chloe Anagnos as the winner of the John R. Emens Outstanding Senior Award.</p>
							<p>In fewer than two hours, senior architecture major Huy Pham posted a screenshot of that email next to a 2013 Ball State Daily News article in which Anagnos defended owning a Confederate flag. Anagnos has since thrown out the flag, but her selection triggered a social media outcry that parallels a long national debate about race.</p>

					<p>I thought video was terrifying. I have shakey hands and didn't want to try doing video. Shortly after I discovered tripods and monopods, my fear of video storytelling disappeared.</p>
					<p>Video adds such an important element to stories. It can be emotionally powerful and educational. I've incorporated feature and news video in the examples below.</p>
					<h2>#BSA Supports Ferguson</h2>					
					<iframe width="100%" height="425" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UFK8ou_vr5w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<p>I missed an extra gym class to do this video, but in light of the events in Ferguson hours before, the Black Student Association held a moment of silence on campus for the family of Michael Brown.</p>
					<p>Students in our largest dining hall on campus joined in prayer and silence with the BSA. They clogged the Atrium and the normal roar of students talking and socializing fell to near silence.</p>

					<iframe width="100%" height="425" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yPb4CqLhCBc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<p>I got the opportunity to write a story for <em>The Sacramento Bee</em>. My internship was supposed to focus solely on digital content, but the feature editor was so impressed with my work on another project, she sent me out to cover Bastille Day in video and print.</p>
					<p>The opening sequence was only possible through the kindness of one of the competitors. I had no background on the event, so I showed up and a waitress kindly wore a GoPro during her competition.</p>
					<p>Bastille Day and the Waiter's Race is such a quirky event in the arts district in Sacramento, and the two people who won both had great uses for the money.</p>

					<h2>Sacramento chefs read mean Yelp! reviews</h2>
					<iframe width="100%" height="425" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hX8NtMvxO4Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<p>This was my third video project. The photo staff at <em>The Sacramento Bee</em> were generous enough to take a digital intern under their wing for improving the quality of my video work. This piece is the product of some of that generosity</p>
					<p>The food beat reporter wanted to do a feature on the local chefs in Sacramento. So, he came to me and the features editor with the crazy idea of putting this video together. My editor thought it was quirky enough to be popular and gave her blessing.</p>
					<p>I learned how to motion track in Final Cut 10 for the last chef's interview.</p>

					<p>This video was the moment I realized that I had the best internship humanly possible. <em>The Sacramento Bee</em> does a fireworks test every year, and this year they wanted a little more dynamic video.</p>
					<p>One of the shots has served as my cell phone lock screen since the end of July. It was fun to put together.</p>
					<p>It's not exactly hard-hitting news video, but it served a purpose for the readers of The Bee.</p>
