					<p>Hey beautiful person! Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Lauren Chapman and I am a student journalist at Ball State University. I'm from Indianapolis, and do a little bit of everything.</p>
					<p>I got into journalism because my high school counselor wouldn't let me take the class I wanted to. She told me to take the newspaper class. I told her I thought journalism was stupid and fluffy. Three years later, I was the second runner-up for the Indiana High School Journalist of the Year.</p>
					<p>I went to Ball State because they gave me awards while I was reporting in high school. The education I received there gave me a well-rounded approach to storytelling. I worked as a print and radio reporter. I spent a long time as a designer.</p>
					<p>Recently, my passion has been for online design and interactive content. No matter what, my passion is storytelling. This almost manic desire to tell people stories and share information led me to learning different methods like audio, video, photography, print and design.</p>
