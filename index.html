					<p>I got into journalism because my high school counselor wouldn't let me take the class I wanted to. She told me to take the newspaper class. I told her I thought journalism was stupid and fluffy. Three years later, I was the second runner-up for the Indiana High School Journalist of the Year.</p>
					<p>I went to Ball State because they gave me awards while I was reporting in high school. The education I received there gave me a well-rounded approach to storytelling. I worked as a print and radio reporter. I spent a long time as a designer. I was accidentally an assistant producer for our student television station. And since January 2014, I've become the web wizard, whose mystical ability to make things happen rivals only how little anyone seems to know about what I do.</p>
					<p>I am nothing if not a storyteller. I would never call myself the best reporter or designer. I am, however, a well-rounded storyteller.</p>
					<b>Other interests:</b>
					<p>I am a baseball fanatic. I've been to the Cooperstown Hall of Fame four times and watched live games in 15 major league ballparks.</p>
					<p>I like silly animals and animal .gifs. I'm a political junkie who never wants to run for office, but is confident I'd do a great job.</p>
					<p>I'm a giant nerd who went to Star Trek conventions as a child and was raised on Batman comic books as bedtime stories.</p>

							<p>Using the open source tool Timeline JS, I created a way for people to interact with content.</p><a href="http://www.ballstatedaily.com/article/2014/10/miss-know-it-all-ebola" target="_blank">READ MORE</a>

							<p>Because of this quiz, we have been able to expand this tool into content promotion. During Homecoming, a quiz about the school's fight song linked to news content.</p><br><a href="http://www.ballstatedaily.com/article/2014/09/village-bar-personality-test" target="_blank">READ MORE</a>

						<h2>DATABASE: See the 2014 California State Fair winners</h2>
							<aside><img src="assets/database-beer.PNG" width="100%"></aside>
							<p>I interned at the <em>Sacramento Bee</em> from May-July 2014. As a pat of that internship, I had the pleasure of working with the data journalist on staff. <em>The Bee</em> used an online database program called Caspio. I was able to work with journalists as a reporter and designer and worked on the appearance and usability of databases.</p>
							<p>The California State Fair hosts food competitions each year. I worked on the beer, wine and cheese databases.</p><a href="http://www.sacbee.com/food-drink/beer/beer-run/article2603503.html" target="_blank">READ MORE</a>

							<p><em>The editor-in-chief at the time found Karla's GoFundMe page on Facebook. She attended my high school and had to find a creative way to raise the money for her tuition. In a moment of happenstance, I found out the state representative from Ball State's area donated money to her cause.</em></p>
							<p>For one incoming freshman, not even a 4.2 GPA and multiple after-school activities can make up for one major obstacle in trying to pay for college.</p>
							<p>Her citizenship status.</p>
							<p>Karla Fernandez was accepted to Ball State for this fall, but she came to the United States without legal permission. Though she has lived in Indiana since she was 3, she does not qualify for in-state tuition or certain scholarships because of legislation that passed in 2011 in Indiana.</p><a href="http://www.ballstatedaily.com/article/2014/05/student-turns-to-crowdfunding-for-tuition-costs" target="_blank">READ MORE</a>

						<h2>Outstanding Senior Award controversy ignites desire for conversation on racial sensitivity at Ball State</h2>
						<p><em>I got to write this story because of the relationships I established with social rights groups on campus. Covering campus protests became my unofficial beat. I received a tip that the people involved in this story would be willing to talk to me. There aren't any photos with the story because the images we could have used would only have promoted one side of the story or the other. I got to approach a very sensitive story with maturity I wouldn't have had a few years ago.</em></p>
							<p>At 10:55 a.m. March 16, students received an email from the university announcing senior journalism and telecommunications major Chloe Anagnos as the winner of the John R. Emens Outstanding Senior Award.</p>
							<p>In fewer than two hours, senior architecture major Huy Pham posted a screenshot of that email next to a 2013 Ball State Daily News article in which Anagnos defended owning a Confederate flag. Anagnos has since thrown out the flag, but her selection triggered a social media outcry that parallels a long national debate about race.</p>

This story came out of a press release from a community newsletter. After tracing these businesses in Davis, I ended up with a great story about a guy who wanted to ride his bike.</em></p>
							<p>John Swann used to commute regularly by bike from Davis to his job in Sacramento, but he'd often get a ride home.
							</p>
							<p>"It's a tough commute," said the semi-retired Swann, who left a software job two years ago and now owns an electric-bicycle business in Davis.</p>
							<p>Looking for a way to get people out of their cars and reduce what can easily be a 40-mile round trip between the cities, he collaborated with other Davis business owners and the Yolo County Visitors Bureau.</p><br><a href="http://www.sacbee.com/community/yolo/article2606255.html" target="_blank">READ MORE</a>

							<em>I get a little fired up about a little bit of everything. MISS KNOW-IT-ALL is my column at the Daily News and soap box. After a personal experience brought the conversation on body-shaming front and center, I could help but write a different perspective on it.</em>
							<p>I am fat.</p>
							<p>It's not exactly a shocking revelation to anyone who has viewed my mugshot for this column. It's positively horrible.</p>
							<p>Recently, I posted on my Facebook account about insensitive comments my PFW lecture had made. My professor had explained to my mostly-freshman class that Type B personalities are normally overweight.</p><a href="http://www.ballstatedaily.com/article/2014/11/miss-know-it-all-fat-shaming" target="_blank">READ MORE</a>

					<p>I missed an extra gym class to do this video, but in light of the events in Ferguson hours before, the Black Student Association held a moment of silence on campus for the family of Michael Brown.</p>
					<p>Students in our largest dining hall on campus joined in prayer and silence with the BSA. They clogged the Atrium and the normal roar of students talking and socializing fell to near silence.</p>

					<iframe width="100%" height="425" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yPb4CqLhCBc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<p>I got the opportunity to write a story for <em>The Sacramento Bee</em>. My internship was supposed to focus solely on digital content, but the feature editor was so impressed with my work on another project, she sent me out to cover Bastille Day in video and print.</p>
					<p>The opening sequence was only possible through the kindness of one of the competitors. I had no background on the event, so I showed up and a waitress kindly wore a GoPro during her competition.</p>
					<p>Bastille Day and the Waiter's Race is such a quirky event in the arts district in Sacramento, and the two people who won both had great uses for the money.</p>

					<h2>Sacramento chefs read mean Yelp! reviews</h2>

					<p>This was my third video project. The photo staff at <em>The Sacramento Bee</em> were generous enough to take a digital intern under their wing for improving the quality of my video work. This piece is the product of some of that generosity</p>
					<p>The food beat reporter wanted to do a feature on the local chefs in Sacramento. So, he came to me and the features editor with the crazy idea of putting this video together. My editor thought it was quirky enough to be popular and gave her blessing.</p>
					<p>I learned how to motion track in Final Cut 10 for the last chef's interview.</p>

					<p>This video was the moment I realized that I had the best internship humanly possible. <em>The Sacramento Bee</em> does a fireworks test every year, and this year they wanted a little more dynamic video.</p>
					<p>One of the shots has served as my cell phone lock screen since the end of July. It was fun to put together.</p>
					<p>It's not exactly hard-hitting news video, but it served a purpose for the readers of The Bee.</p>
